# Packing Station Implementation Overview

## Domain-Driven Design Approach

### Key Aggregates
1. **Package Aggregate**
   - Responsible for managing the lifecycle of a package
   - Ensures business rules around package creation and confirmation
   - Validates packed items against original order

2. **PackedItem Value Object**
   - Represents individual items packed into a package
   - Immutable representation of SKU and quantity

### Workflow Validation
- Packages can only be confirmed when:
  - All ordered items are packed
  - Quantities match exactly
  - No extra or missing items

## Key Components

### Domain Objects
- `Package`: Aggregate root managing package state
- `PackedItem`: Value object representing packed items
- `PackageStatus`: Enum tracking package lifecycle (PENDING, CONFIRMED)

### Services
- `PackingStationService`: Orchestrates package creation and management

### Validation Rules
- Packages start in PENDING status
- Items can only be added to non-confirmed packages
- Package confirmation requires:
  - At least one packed item
  - Exact match of order items
  - No extra or missing items

## Testing Strategy
- Unit Tests: Validate domain object behavior
- Integration Tests: Verify complete workflow
- Test Scenarios Covered:
  - Successful package creation
  - Item addition
  - Package confirmation
  - Validation failures (incomplete/extra items)

## Key Design Principles
- Immutability
- Strong type safety
- Clear separation of concerns
- Explicit business rule enforcement

## Future Improvements
- Add logging
- Implement more complex validation rules
- Support partial package confirmations
- Add audit trail for package modifications
