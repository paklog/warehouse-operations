### Weekly Sprint Planning:
- **Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Velocity**: Focus on completing 1-2 major components per sprint
- **Review Cycle**: Weekly technical reviews and integration testing

## Success Metrics

### Completion Targets by Phase:
- **Phase 1**: 60% implementation coverage
- **Phase 2**: 75% implementation coverage  
- **Phase 3**: 85% implementation coverage
- **Phase 4**: 95% implementation coverage
- **Phase 5-7**: 100% production-ready

### Quality Gates:
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% unit test coverage
- **Performance**: API response times < 200ms for 95th percentile
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for core operations
- **Security**: Pass security audit with no critical vulnerabilities

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- **Database Performance**: Implement proper indexing and query optimization
- **Event Ordering**: Use event sourcing patterns for critical workflows
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling from the beginning
- **Data Consistency**: Implement proper transaction boundaries

### Project Risks:
- **Scope Creep**: Maintain strict phase boundaries and requirements
- **Integration Complexity**: Start with simple integrations and iterate
- **Performance Issues**: Implement monitoring early in development
- **Quality Debt**: Maintain test coverage and code review practices

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions** (Week 1-2):
   - Set up development environment and tooling
   - Begin repository implementations
   - Establish CI/CD pipeline basics
   - Create detailed technical specifications

2. **Short Term** (Month 1):
   - Complete Phase 1 foundation infrastructure
   - Begin Phase 2 application services
   - Establish testing frameworks and practices

3. **Medium Term** (Months 2-3):
   - Complete application services layer
   - Implement REST APIs for core operations
   - Begin advanced domain services

4. **Long Term** (Months 4-6):
   - Complete all advanced features
   - Achieve production readiness
   - Deploy to production environment
